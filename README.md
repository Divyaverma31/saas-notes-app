# Multi-Tenant SaaS Notes Application

A complete web application that allows multiple companies (tenants) to manage their own notes securely. Each company's data is completely separate and secure from other companies.

## What This Application Does

This is a note-taking application designed for businesses where:
- Multiple companies can use the same application
- Each company's data is completely isolated and secure
- Companies have different subscription plans (Free and Pro)
- Users have different roles with different permissions

## Key Features

### Multi-Company Support (Multi-Tenancy)
- Two demo companies are set up: Acme Corp and Globex Inc
- Each company's notes are completely separate
- No company can see another company's data

### User Authentication and Roles
- Secure login system using JWT tokens
- Two types of users:
  - **Admin**: Can manage subscriptions and invite users
  - **Member**: Can only create and manage notes

### Subscription Plans
- **Free Plan**: Companies can create up to 3 notes
- **Pro Plan**: Unlimited notes
- Admins can upgrade their company's subscription

### Note Management
- Create new notes with title and content
- View all your company's notes
- Edit existing notes
- Delete notes you no longer need

### Modern Web Interface
- Clean, responsive design that works on all devices
- Easy-to-use login with dropdown for test accounts
- Real-time updates when you reach subscription limits
- Professional dashboard showing company information

## Test Accounts

You can test the application using these pre-configured accounts (all passwords are "password"):

### Acme Corp Users
- **admin@acme.test** - Administrator role, can upgrade subscription
- **user@acme.test** - Member role, can only manage notes

### Globex Inc Users
- **admin@globex.test** - Administrator role, can upgrade subscription  
- **user@globex.test** - Member role, can only manage notes

## How to Use

1. **Login**: Select one of the test accounts from the dropdown menu
2. **Dashboard**: See your company info and current subscription plan
3. **Create Notes**: Click "Create New Note" to add a new note
4. **Manage Notes**: Edit or delete existing notes from the dashboard
5. **Upgrade**: If you're an admin and reach the 3-note limit, you can upgrade to Pro

## Technical Architecture

### Multi-Tenancy Approach
I chose the "shared schema with tenant ID" approach because:
- It's cost-effective (one database for all companies)
- Easy to maintain and update
- Scales well with proper security
- Simpler to develop and deploy

### Security Features
- All data is filtered by company ID automatically
- Cross-company data access is impossible
- Secure password hashing
- JWT tokens that expire after 24 hours
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express framework
- **Frontend**: Modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Deployment**: Vercel serverless platform
- **Database**: In-memory storage (demo purposes)

## API Endpoints

The application provides these REST API endpoints:

### Health and Status
- GET /health - Check if the application is running

### User Authentication
- POST /auth/login - Login with email and password
- GET /auth/me - Get current user information

### Notes Management
- GET /notes - Get all notes for your company
- POST /notes - Create a new note
- GET /notes/:id - Get a specific note
- PUT /notes/:id - Update an existing note
- DELETE /notes/:id - Delete a note

### Subscription Management
- POST /tenants/:slug/upgrade - Upgrade to Pro plan (Admin only)
- GET /tenants/:slug - Get company information and stats

## Getting Started Locally

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Server**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open Your Browser**
   Go to http://localhost:5000

4. **Test the Application**
   ```
   node test-endpoints.js http://localhost:5000
   ```

## Deployment to Production

The application is designed to deploy easily to Vercel:

1. **Push to GitHub**: Upload your code to a GitHub repository
2. **Connect Vercel**: Link your GitHub repo to Vercel
3. **Set Environment Variable**: Add JWT_SECRET in Vercel dashboard
4. **Deploy**: Vercel automatically builds and deploys your app
5. **Test**: Run the test script against your live URL

See DEPLOYMENT.md for detailed step-by-step instructions.

## Testing and Validation

The included test script validates:
- All API endpoints work correctly
- User authentication with all test accounts
- Company data isolation is enforced
- Role-based permissions work properly
- Subscription limits are enforced correctly
- Upgrade functionality works
- Frontend is accessible and functional

## Security Considerations

### Data Isolation
- Every database query is automatically filtered by company ID
- Users can only access their own company's data
- Cross-company data leaks are prevented by design

### Authentication Security
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- JWT tokens expire automatically
- Invalid tokens are rejected
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated
- SQL injection prevention (though using in-memory storage)
- XSS protection through proper escaping

## Production Considerations

For a real production deployment, you would want to:

### Database Migration
- Replace in-memory storage with PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- Add database connection pooling
- Implement proper data backup strategies

### Enhanced Security
- Use environment-specific JWT secrets
- Add request logging and monitoring
- Implement proper audit trails
- Add email verification for new users

### Performance Optimization
- Add Redis caching layer
- Implement database indexing
- Use CDN for static assets
- Add response compression

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- Set up error tracking (like Sentry)
- Add performance monitoring
- Implement health checks
- Create automated backups

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Login Problems**: Check that you're using the correct test account emails
- **Notes Not Showing**: Verify you're logged in and using the right company account
- **Cannot Create Notes**: Check if you've reached the 3-note limit on Free plan
- **Upgrade Not Working**: Make sure you're logged in as an Admin user

### Getting Help
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Review the test script output for specific failures
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- Check Vercel function logs if deployed
